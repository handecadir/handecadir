# About Me 👋

Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Molecular Biology with a deep passion for unraveling the complexities of life at the molecular level. 

## 🔬 Research Interests
- **Glycosylation:** The role and effects of glycans on cell surfaces and proteins.
- **Bioinformatics & Statistical Genomics:** Leveraging large-scale genomic datasets (GWAS, eQTL, transcriptomics) for deeper biological insights.
- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):** Investigating the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying PCOS
- **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):** Exploring the genetic architecture and neurodevelopmental pathways associated with ASD through statistical genomics and bioinformatics approaches.
- **Variant Analysis:** Identifying and characterizing genetic variants associated with complex traits using GWAS, eQTL mapping, and integrative multi-omics approaches.

## 🌱 Learning and Growing
- I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in advanced statistical analysis and data visualization in R.
- I'm expanding my expertise in MR methodologies, GWAS data analysis, and functional genomics.
- I'm exploring multi-omics data integration to uncover novel biological mechanisms.
