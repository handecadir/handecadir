# About Me 👋

Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Molecular Biology with a deep passion for unraveling the complexities of life at the molecular level. My research primarily focuses on cancer biology, with a particular interest in gene expression and Glycosylation.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- **Glycosylation:** The role and effects of glycans on cell surfaces and proteins.
- **Cancer Biology:** Molecular mechanisms related to cancer development and prognosis.
- **Bioinformatics:** Utilizing computational tools to analyze large-scale omics data (TCGA, FPKM, count data).
- **Long Non-Coding RNAs:** Their functions in cellular processes and relationships to cancer.
- **Machine Learning:** Applying machine learning techniques for data analysis and modeling.

## 🌱 Learning and Growing
- I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in advanced statistical analysis and data visualization in R.
- Interested in the integration of multi-omics data to uncover novel insights into cancer biology.
